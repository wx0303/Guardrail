### 1. Input Guard Rail

- [PromptArmor: Simple yet Effective Prompt Injection Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15219)
  - 🔑 Key: defense
  - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agents / LLM Agents 
  - 📖 TLDR: This paper revisits a simple LLM-based defense for prompt injection attacks. Instead of training a new detector or modifying the target agent, PromptArmor uses an off-the-shelf LLM as a preprocessing defense: it inspects untrusted external content, identifies injected malicious instructions, removes or rewrites them, and then passes the cleaned content to the downstream agent. The method is simple to deploy, works with black-box agents, and shows strong results on benchmarks such as AgentDojo and OpenPromptInject, reducing attack success while preserving task utility.
